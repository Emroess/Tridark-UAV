# Tridark-UAV

A smart, easy to maufacture, versatile drone plane. 

Mission: to disprove participating in robotics & aerospace requires a PhD.

### Version 1:
In version 1, I plan to assemble the Flightory Stallion VTOL aiframe and add the SpeedyBee F405 flight controller to become flight capable. 

Concerens and possible issues:
- Smooth transistion between horizonal flight and VTOL mode.
- Determining the center of mass for efficent and smooth flight.
- Mounting of the elctronics to prevent a shift in center of mass.
- Propeller size/type. Do 7x5 propellers produce enough lift? How do I properly pair a propeller with the KV of the motor?

**Pixhawk 6X Flight Controller**
- STM32 Bit Arm Microprocessor 480MHz/2MB flash memory/1MB RAM _(I intend to learn more about STM32 microprocessor programming)._ 

**Modualar and modifiable airframe**
- Able to 3d print on a small 180×180×180mm printer _(I am printing on a Prusa Mini+)._
