# Tridark-UAV

An autonomous and versatile drone plane capable of vertical take off and landing (VTOL). 

Mission: to test and learn about the airframe and electronics in an autonomous drone.

## Version 1 Goal: 
**To assemble the Flightory Stallion VTOL airframe and have a stable flight capable airframe by March 28th.**

**Measured Steps:**
- Funding.
- Purchase materials for building the airframe.
- Purchase electronics needed to make the airframe fly in both VTOL and horizonal flight modes.
- Airframe assembly. 
- Installing and configuring electronics.
- Test flights.
- Tuning VTOL to horizonal flight transition. 
- Flight practice.
  
**Constraints:**
- 3D print volume (I am printing on a Prusa Mini+ which has a print volume of 180×180×180mm).
- Funding.
- March 8th test flight (would like to take the plane to a rocketry and plane launch meeting).
- Component shipping time.
