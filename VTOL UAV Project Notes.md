1. **T-Motor F90 2806.5 Long Range Motor 5-6S KV1300 (**[https://store.tmotor.com/product/f90-fpv-motor.html](https://store.tmotor.com/product/f90-fpv-motor.html)**)**  
- Provides an optimum mix of efficiency and KV(1300) to lift a varying payload weight. 

2. **Pixhawk 6X-RT (Developer Edition) (**[https://holybro.com/collections/autopilot-flight-controllers/products/fmuv6x-rt-developer-edition?variant=43127568498877](https://holybro.com/collections/autopilot-flight-controllers/products/fmuv6x-rt-developer-edition?variant=43127568498877)**)**  
- Crucial to the project, the flight management unit or FMU is what controls the drone during active flight and inputs senor information to make real time flight updates. The Pixhawk 6X-RT contains triple redundant IMUs & double redundant barometers on separate buses and includes an ethernet interface for high-speed mission computer integration. It can run open source flight software such as Ardupilot and PX4pro which will allow the builder detailed control of the drone and a way to learn complex technologies used by drone companies in the US.

     **3\.  Tekko32 F4 4in1 Mini 50A ESC         (**[https://holybro.com/collections/autopilot-peripherals/products/tekko32-f4-4in1-mini-50a-escam32](https://holybro.com/collections/autopilot-peripherals/products/tekko32-f4-4in1-mini-50a-escam32)**)**

- A compact and lightweight electronic speed controller that supports DShot communication between flight controller (FC) and Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). DShot is a digital communication protocol that is resistant to electrical noise and jitter compared to conventional Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The ESC also supports 50A continuous output per channel (4).

     **4\.  Remote ID           (**[https://holybro.com/collections/flight-controller-accessories/products/remote-id?variant=43034167279805](https://holybro.com/collections/flight-controller-accessories/products/remote-id?variant=43034167279805)**)**

- A required radio transmitter needed to meet the FAAâ€™s remote ID requirement for drones/UAVs larger than 250g. See: [https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting\_started/remote\_id](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id)

     **5\.  H-RTK ZED-F9P Rover (RM3100 Compass)**  
**(**[https://holybro.com/collections/dronecan-h-rtk/products/h-rtk-zed-f9p-rover](https://holybro.com/collections/dronecan-h-rtk/products/h-rtk-zed-f9p-rover)**)**

- A compact high precision GPS and compass that provides the FMU with location and heading. An important component for autonomous flight and for future automatic heading correction when integrated with a secondary ground station GPS. 

  

   **6\.  SILK Telemetry Radios**  
**(**[https://holybro.com/collections/telemetry-radios/products/sik-telemetry-radio-v3?variant=42801818239165](https://holybro.com/collections/telemetry-radios/products/sik-telemetry-radio-v3?variant=42801818239165)**)**

- Allows for simplex telemetry radio communication using the MAVlink protocol. Is what allows for a two way radio communication between ground station and UAV. Important for receiving live flight information, errors, battery percentage, or for disarming and locating the drone incase of a crash. 

   **7\. Lipo Batteries (**[https://a.co/d/hmonPgN](https://a.co/d/hmonPgN)) & ([https://a.co/d/aU06GwH](https://a.co/d/aU06GwH))  
Is the primary source of power for the entire UAV. 

- **Option 1 (**[https://a.co/d/hmonPgN](https://a.co/d/hmonPgN))**:** 6000mAh with 100C peak output is a good battery combination for when longer flights are desired or when a larger payload is loaded.   
- **Option 2**([https://a.co/d/aU06GwH](https://a.co/d/aU06GwH))**:** 5200mAh is a lighter battery with less peak output power. Having different battery sizes allows me to test weight/power output to find a balance between flight time and payload capacity.
